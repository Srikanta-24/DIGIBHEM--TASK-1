# DIGIBHEM--TASK-1
contains the code and the description of fake news detection 

Welcome to the Fake News Detection Python project! This project aims to help you build a machine learning model that can distinguish between fake news and genuine news articles using natural language processing techniques. The ability to identify fake news can play a crucial role in promoting accurate information and combating misinformation.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of labeled news articles, where each article is labeled as either fake or genuine. You can download the dataset from [source link here]. The dataset is divided into a training set and a testing set.

Model
The machine learning model in this project utilizes a combination of techniques, including text preprocessing, feature extraction (TF-IDF, word embeddings, etc.), and classification algorithms (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.). The model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the testing set.
